# NER_WITH_CRF
Feature Subset Selection in Conditional Random Fields for Named Entity Recognition

The project makes use of a statistical modelling method Conditional Random Fields
for Named Entity Recognition.CRF is an undirected graph-based model that considered words that not only occur before the entity but also after it.To build an NER system for diseases and treatment,experimented with various subsets of feautures to
evaluate their importance through the model performance.Final goal is to identify the most useful features for this task.

For Details and better understanding go through [Report](https://github.com/venkma/NER_WITH_CRF/blob/master/Detailed_Report_NER_FINAL.pdf).
